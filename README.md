#Final Project Proposal
---------------------
Sophomore year, my fling with film photography began with a Canon Elphi 2 I bought
off of EBay. I used her mostly to shoot pals and places around NYC with expired API film.
When I went abroad last year, I stole my roommate's ~nice~ film camera and brought it everywhere with me.  The result is an abundance of mediocre to good photos and nowhere good to store them all.  Therefore, for my project, I am planning on making an interface to dynamically display all these photos in something other than just a Facebook album.  

Currently, I am thinking of organizing the three different sections to fit more of a mood or theme rather than sorting by place.  The sketch I have now consists of pairings of landscapes shot in API film and portraits of pals either shot on API or disposable. Another page will be a little more functional, more of a travel log of all my favorite photos of places I went with interactivity that will tell the user the place, time I went, and why that memory is special to me.  

The last one will be the least functional in terms of displaying photos. My plan with this page is it function as an HTML collage that you scroll through. I want to manipulate a lot of the photos in Photoshop – applying cool effects, cutting elements out, etc – and animate elements within them to create a dynamic, moving page. If time permits, I’d love to manipulate some of the photos using HTML canvas.

I imagine the interface for the three collections will be on the simpler side in order to avoid having the project look too cluttered, just three thumbnails of some of the photos to show the vibe of each page accompanied by just a title of the different sections and the pages. I am picturing this as similar to the layout of the HMTL Canvas assignment but all fitting within one page.
