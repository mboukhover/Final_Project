Spatial_or_Spacial
---------------------
Sophomore year, my fling with film photography began when I purchased a Canon Elphi 2
off of EBay. I used her mostly to shoot pals and places around NYC with expired API film.
When I went abroad last year, I stole my roommate's *nice* film camera and brought it everywhere with me.  The result is an abundance of mediocre to good photos collecting dust.

At first, I became interested in manipulating analog media through a computer. Through exploratory process, I began playing with the idea of the computer as a place where time and space can become,
by some measures, flattened. I isolated different elements from photographs of my travels and used
code to collage them together. Without context, buildings from East 12th New York, Madrid, and Versailles easily exist within the same space - the computer screen. The boats of Berlin sail in Monet's garden, a train ride to Austria can be seen through a tunnel in Budapest. These scenes are combined with
code manipulated backgrounds in order to emulate movement within the landscapes.
